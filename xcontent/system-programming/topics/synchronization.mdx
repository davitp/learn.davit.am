# Synchronization and Critical Sections

## Overview
This week explores one of the most important challenges in multithreaded programming — **synchronization**.  
Students will understand how **race conditions** arise when multiple threads access shared data concurrently, and how to control access to critical sections using **synchronization primitives** such as mutexes, spinlocks, semaphores, condition variables, and atomic operations.

## Key Concepts

#### Concurrency and Race Conditions
- **Race condition:** when multiple threads access and modify shared data simultaneously, leading to unpredictable results.  
- **Critical section:** a segment of code that must not be executed by more than one thread at a time.  
- **Data consistency:** maintaining integrity of shared resources under concurrent access.

#### Synchronization Primitives
- **Mutex (Mutual Exclusion Lock):**  
  - Ensures only one thread executes a critical section at a time.  
  - Core functions: `pthread_mutex_init`, `pthread_mutex_lock`, `pthread_mutex_unlock`, `pthread_mutex_destroy`.  

- **Spinlock:**  
  - Lightweight lock that continuously checks availability without sleeping.  
  - Suitable for short critical sections on multicore systems.  

- **Semaphore:**  
  - A counter-based synchronization mechanism for controlling access to a finite number of resources.  
  - POSIX functions: `sem_init`, `sem_wait`, `sem_post`, `sem_destroy`.  

- **Condition Variable:**  
  - Used for signaling between threads.  
  - Allows a thread to wait until a certain condition becomes true.  
  - Core functions: `pthread_cond_wait`, `pthread_cond_signal`, `pthread_cond_broadcast`.  

- **Atomic Operations and CAS (Compare-And-Swap):**  
  - Low-level operations ensuring atomic updates without explicit locks.  
  - Foundation for lock-free synchronization structures.

#### Deadlocks and Starvation (Intro)
- Circular wait, hold and wait, no preemption, mutual exclusion — the four conditions for deadlock.
- Techniques to avoid or detect deadlocks will be discussed in future weeks.

## Practice
#### Demonstrating Race Conditions
- Create a shared counter updated by multiple threads without locks — observe inconsistent results.  
- Protect the counter using a mutex and verify correct output.

#### Working with Mutexes
- Use a mutex to protect a critical section in a multi-threaded program.  
- Experiment with `pthread_mutex_trylock` and `PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE`.

#### Using Semaphores
- Implement a simple producer-consumer synchronization using semaphores.

#### Condition Variables
- Demonstrate thread signaling (one thread waits until another signals a condition).  
- Compare busy-waiting vs. condition-based waiting.

#### Spinlocks and Atomics
- Experiment with short critical sections using spinlocks.  
- Observe CPU utilization differences compared to mutexes.
