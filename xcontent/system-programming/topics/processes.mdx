# Processes

## Overview
This week introduces the **process model** — the fundamental abstraction for executing programs in an operating system.  
Students will learn how processes are created, how they relate to one another, and how Linux represents and manages them.  
We will also briefly explore **virtual memory** and its role in isolating processes, followed by the main system calls for creating and controlling processes.

By the end of this week, students will understand how programs become running processes, how parent and child processes interact, and how process management underpins multitasking in Linux.

## Key Concepts

### What is a Process?
- A process as an executing program instance  
- Process attributes: PID, state, program counter, registers, open files  
- Process lifecycle: creation → execution → termination  
- Relationship between **programs** and **processes**  
- Context switching overview  

### Virtual Memory (Brief Overview)
- Concept of process isolation  
- Logical vs physical address spaces  
- Paging: mapping memory in fixed-size blocks (pages)  
- Role of MMU and page tables (at a high level)  
- How virtual memory supports multitasking and protection  

### Process Hierarchy and Inheritance
- The process tree: `init`/`systemd` as ancestor of all processes  
- Parent and child relationships  
- Inheritance of environment variables and file descriptors  
- Process groups and sessions  

### Process Creation and Execution
- `fork()` — duplicating the current process  
- Return semantics of `fork()` (0 in child, PID in parent)  
- `exec()` family — replacing the current process image  
- `getpid()`, `getppid()` — identifying process lineage  
- `wait()` and `waitpid()` — synchronizing process termination  
- Zombies and orphan processes

## Practice / Lab

### Exploring the Process Tree
- Use shell tools (`ps`, `pstree`, `top`, `htop`) to inspect running processes.  
- Identify parent-child relationships and PIDs.  
- Observe behavior when starting background jobs (`&`) and pipelines.

### Process Creation
- Write a simple program that spawns child processes using `fork()`.  
- Observe execution order and differences in PID and PPID.  

### Executing New Programs
- Use `exec()` to replace a process image and observe that it does not return.  
- Combine `fork()` and `exec()` to launch external commands from your program.

### Process Synchronization
- Use `wait()` and `waitpid()` to ensure orderly termination of child processes.  
- Observe zombie processes when a parent does not wait.

## Quiz (Self-check)

1. What is the difference between a program and a process?  
2. What does virtual memory achieve in process isolation?  
3. What are the main differences between `fork()` and `exec()`?  
4. What is inherited by a child process after `fork()`?  
5. What happens if a parent process never calls `wait()`?  
6. What is a zombie process, and how is it removed?  
7. How do `getpid()` and `getppid()` relate within a process tree?

## Suggested Tools
- `ps`, `pstree`, `top`, `htop` – inspect running processes  
- `strace` – trace `fork`, `exec`, `wait` system calls  
- `pmap` – display memory map of a process  
- `lsof` – list open files for a given process
