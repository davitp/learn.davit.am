    Unlock interprocess communication in C++ on Linux with 'shared_array' class. Easily share integer arrays between processes, initialize with custom names and sizes, and seamlessly access elements with operator []. Perfect for implementing cross-process synchronization using semaphores.

# IPC-3: Shared array implementation

### Requirements 

- Write a C++ class implementing a module **shared_array** which is an array of integers shared between processes.
- The class is supposed to be initialized as follows: shared_array array("array-name", size);
- The size of the array (number of elements) could be between 1 and 1 000 000 000
- Two shared arrays are the same in the system if they have equal names and sizes, otherwise, they are different. 
- The class should provide operator [] for indexing an element with a given index i.
- Any process that knows the name and the size of the array should be able to use it.
- Write two infinite programs (first and second) to work with the shared array using cross-process semaphore.

### Expected result

The resulting application should be able to build from the command line as follows:

```sh
make first
make second
```
The execution of the program should demonstrate how the array changes from the first and second processes.

The final solution should contain a **Makefile** for the multi-stage build. The Makefile should also contain targets **all** and **clean**. It's recommended to have compiler and compiler flags declared as Makefile variables. Alternatively, **cmake** could also be used instead of make.
