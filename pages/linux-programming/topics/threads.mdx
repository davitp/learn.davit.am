# Threading: Parallelism and Concurrency

## Topic Outline
### Overview of Memory Layout: Heap and Stack
    - Understanding the memory layout of a process, including the heap and stack.
    - Explaining the concept of the call stack and its role in thread execution.

### The Concept of Thread and Thread Context
    - Introducing the concept of a thread and its execution context.
    - Highlighting the main differences between a process and a thread in terms of isolation, memory management, and scheduling.

### Understanding Parallelism and Concurrency
    - Explaining the difference between parallel and concurrent execution.
    - Understanding how threads enable concurrent execution within a single process.

### Introduction to Pthread Library
    - Overview of the Pthread library (POSIX threads) for thread programmability.
    - Covering essential functions for creating, joining, and cancelling threads using the Pthread API.
