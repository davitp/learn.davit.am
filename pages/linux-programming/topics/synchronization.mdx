# Introduction to Synchronization Problems

## Outline
### Understanding Synchronization Problems
    - Introduction to synchronization problems and the reasons they occur in multi-threaded and multi-process environments.

### Definition of Race Condition, Atomicity, and Critical Section
    - Explaining the concept of race conditions and how they arise.
    - Understanding atomicity and its importance in preventing race conditions.
    - Defining the critical section and its role in synchronization.

### Overview of Synchronization Primitives
    - Introducing key synchronization primitives such as mutexes, semaphores, spin locks, and compare-and-swap (CAS) operations.
    - Discussing the usage scenarios for each primitive.

### Differences Between Synchronization Primitives and Their Drawbacks
    - Comparing synchronization primitives and their performance implications.
    - Highlighting the potential drawbacks and limitations of each primitive.

## Practice
### Demonstrating a Race Condition
    - Writing a multi-threaded program to illustrate a race condition.
    - Analyzing the output to understand the nature of race conditions.

### Solving Race Conditions Using Synchronization Primitives
    - Implementing solutions to race conditions using synchronization primitives such as mutexes and spin locks.
    - Writing code examples to show the correct usage of these primitives.

### Comparing Performance Overhead of Synchronization Primitives
    - Programmatically comparing the performance overhead of different synchronization primitives in various scenarios.
    - Conducting experiments to measure and analyze the impact of synchronization on program efficiency.
