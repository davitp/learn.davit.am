# The File Systems API and File Manipulations from Code

## Overview
- Providing a basic understanding of file abstractions in the API.
- Explaining the concept of file descriptors and their role in file operations.
- Covering main file operations such as creat, open, read, write, and close.

## Outline
### Concept of File Descriptors
   - Understanding file descriptors as integer values representing open files.
   - Explaining the standard input (stdin) and standard output (stdout) file descriptors.

### Working with Files Using File System API Functions
   - Introduction to essential file system API functions: open, read, write, close.
   - Exploring their parameters and return values.

### Proper Error Handling with System Calls
   - Emphasizing the importance of error handling while using file system API functions.
   - Utilizing the "errno" variable to identify and handle errors.

## Practice
### Writing Simple Programs to Demonstrate File Operations
   - Hands-on exercises to demonstrate main file operations such as file creation, reading, writing, and closing.
   - Practical examples to reinforce understanding of file system API functions.

### Demonstrating Redirection of Standard Input and Output Streams
   - Writing programs to demonstrate redirection of standard input and output streams using basic open/close operations.
   - Understanding how to manipulate file descriptors for redirection purposes.
