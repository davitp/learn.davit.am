# Advanced IO with File Systems API

## Overview
- Exploring more advanced functionalities provided by the File Systems API for file manipulations.
- Understanding concepts such as file descriptor duplication and granular control over file descriptors during file operations.
- Delving into the seek operation and its various modes, including handling holes and sparse files.

## Outline
### Controlling Standard Input, Output, and Error Streams
    - Understanding file descriptor duplication with functions like dup and dup2.
    - Exploring their applications in controlling standard streams for input/output redirection.

### Granular Control Over Open File Descriptors
    - Examining advanced options for opening files, including truncate-on-open, create-if-does-not-exist, and temporary files.
    - Understanding how these options provide more flexibility and control in file handling.

### Seek Operation (lseek) on Open Files
    - Explaining the seek operation and its significance in navigating through files.
    - Understanding various modes of seeking the file and their applications.

### Holes and Sparse Files
    - Understanding the concept of holes and sparse files.
    - Exploring how to create sparse files using the seek operation and detecting holes within files.

## Practice
### Advanced File Operations Using Shell
    - Practical exercises involving advanced file operations in the shell, such as stream redirection, input/output piping, and utilities like grep and dd.
    - Demonstrating how to leverage shell capabilities for efficient file handling.

### Random File Access Using lseek
    - Hands-on exercises to perform read and write operations at random file locations using the lseek function.
    - Understanding the importance of random access in certain file manipulation scenarios.

### Creating Sparse Files and Detecting Holes
    - Practical demonstrations of creating sparse files using the lseek operation.
    - Exercises to detect and handle holes within sparse files for optimized file storage.
