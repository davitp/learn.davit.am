# Overview of Unix Processes

## Outline
### Definition of Process and Process Tree
    - Understanding the concept of a process as a program in execution state.
    - Introduction to the init process and the hierarchical tree structure of processes.

### Introduction to Virtual Memory
    - Brief overview of virtual memory and its role in process execution.
    - Explaining concepts such as pages and page tables within the virtual memory of a process.

### Properties of a Process
    - Exploring key properties of processes, including process ID (pid) and file descriptor table.
    - Understanding other process-related attributes essential for management and identification.

### Process Creation Workflow
    - Understanding the process creation workflow through functions like fork and clone.
    - Explaining the parent-child relationship and the lifecycle of a process.

### Execution of Programs in Processes
    - Overview of executing programs within a process using exec* functions.
    - Understanding how these functions replace the current process image with a new one.

## Practice
### Practical Overview of the Process Tree
    - Hands-on exploration of the process tree using shell commands like ps.
    - Understanding the structure and relationships within the process hierarchy.

### Demonstration of Process Lifecycle
    - Writing a simple program to demonstrate the lifecycle of a process using fork, wait, and exec functions.
    - Practical exercises to illustrate process creation, execution, and termination.

### Usage of Command Line Arguments and Environment Variables
    - Demonstrating the usage of command line arguments with exec functions.
    - Understanding the inheritance of environment variables between parent and child processes.
