# Unix Filesystem Basics

## Overview
Building on the introductory tour of Linux, this week deepens your understanding of the command-line interface and the structure of the Unix filesystem.  
You will learn how to use shell commands effectively, explore standard directories and their purposes, understand file types (regular files, directories, devices, links), and manage users, groups, and permissions.

By the end of this week you should be able to confidently navigate the filesystem, interpret file metadata, and control access rights using the shell.

## Key Concepts
- The shell as an interface: command syntax, arguments, options  
- Command synopsis and using `man` pages  
- Standard Linux directory hierarchy (`/bin`, `/etc`, `/home`, `/var`, `/proc`, `/dev`, …)  
- File types: regular, directory, character/block devices, sockets, FIFOs  
- Hard links vs. symbolic (soft) links  
- Users, groups, and ownership model  
- File permissions: read/write/execute, `chmod`, `chown`, `chgrp`

## Practice / Lab
- **Shell Exploration:**  
  - Use `man`, `which`, `type` to discover command info  
  - Practice navigation with `cd`, `pwd`, `ls -l`, `tree`  
- **Filesystem Walk:**  
  - Inspect the top-level folders under `/`  
  - Explore `/proc` and `/dev` for virtual and device files  
- **Working with Links:**  
  - Create hard and symbolic links (`ln`, `ln -s`) and examine inode numbers with `ls -i`  
- **Permissions Management:**  
  - Check file metadata with `ls -l`  
  - Change mode and ownership (`chmod`, `chown`, `chgrp`)  
  - Experiment with `umask` and default file permissions  
- **Users & Groups:**  
  - Inspect `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group`  
  - Use `id`, `who`, `groups` to view account information
