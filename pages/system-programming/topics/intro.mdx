# Introduction to Unix and Linux

## Overview  
In this first week, we establish the foundation for system programming. Students will explore what an operating system is, how kernels are structured, and how Linux fits into the broader family of operating systems. We also introduce GNU/Linux distributions, the concept of free and open-source software, and the shell as the main interface to the system.  

By the end of this week, students will have a working Linux environment, a basic understanding of the command line, and an introduction to version control with Git and GitHub.

## Key Concepts  
- What is an operating system? Roles and responsibilities  
- Kernel vs. user space; system calls as the bridge  
- Kernel architectures: monolithic, microkernel, hybrid  
- Unix lineage and Linux history (vs. Windows, macOS, BSD)  
- GNU/Linux ecosystem: distributions and package managers  
- The shell: prompt, commands, redirection, and pipelines  

---

## Practice / Lab  
- **Set up a Virtual Machine:** Install Ubuntu (or another Linux distribution) on VirtualBox/VMware.  
- **Command Line Basics:**  
  - Run and understand `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `man`, `echo`, `cat`  
  - Try redirection (`>`, `>>`) and pipelines (`|`)  
  - Install software with `apt` or your distro’s package manager  
- **Development Environment Setup:** Install and test `gcc`, `g++`, `make`, and `git`. Configure an editor (e.g., VS Code or Vim).  
- **Git & GitHub Essentials:** Initialize a local repo, make a commit, and push to GitHub.  
- **Exploring Distributions:** Find your kernel version (`uname -a`) and distro info (`lsb_release -a`). Compare Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, Debian.
