# Multithreading and POSIX Threads

## Overview
This week introduces **threads** as lightweight units of execution within a process.  
Students will learn how threads differ from processes, how they share resources, and how to use the **POSIX Threads (pthreads)** API to create, synchronize, and manage them effectively in Linux.

## Key Concepts
- **Threads vs. Processes**
  - A process has its own memory space; threads share the same address space.
  - Threads enable concurrent execution within a single process.
  - Threads are more efficient for parallel tasks that share data.

- **POSIX Threads (pthreads)**
  - Standardized API for thread programming in UNIX/Linux environments.
  - Main functions:
    - `pthread_create()` — create a new thread
    - `pthread_join()` — wait for a thread to complete
    - `pthread_exit()` — terminate the current thread
    - `pthread_self()` — obtain the thread ID
    - `pthread_detach()` — run thread independently (no `join`)

- **Thread Lifecycle**
  - States: new → runnable → running → terminated
  - Resource management: stack, thread ID, attributes
  - Detached vs. joinable threads and their memory implications

- **Thread Safety**
  - Shared memory requires careful access to avoid conflicts (to be covered later).
  - Distinguish between *thread-safe* and *non-thread-safe* library functions.

## Practice
### Thread Creation
- Write a simple program that spawns multiple threads using `pthread_create()`.
- Pass arguments to threads and print thread identifiers with `pthread_self()`.

### Joining and Detaching
- Use `pthread_join()` to synchronize thread completion.
- Create detached threads using `pthread_detach()` and observe behavior.

### Thread Attributes
- Experiment with `pthread_attr_t` to set stack size or detach state.
- Observe resource usage differences using tools like `htop` (`Shift + H`).

### Observation
- Compare thread vs. process creation times using `time` and simple benchmarks.

## Quiz (Self-Check)
1. What is the key difference between a process and a thread?  
2. Which function is used to create a new thread in POSIX?  
3. What happens if a joinable thread finishes without being joined?  
4. What is the purpose of `pthread_detach()`?  
5. Why do threads share the same memory space, and what are the implications of this?  
6. What information does `pthread_self()` return?
